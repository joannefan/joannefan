- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joanne, a second-year student studying computer science at Tufts University.
- ðŸ‘€ Itâ€™s a goal of mine to dive deeper into the programming world, of which Iâ€™ve only scratched the tip of the iceberg.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Javascript/React Native, in addition to C++ and C which are the primary languages I code in.
- ðŸ˜Š Besides programming, I enjoy singing, playing the piano, sketching, photography, reading philosophical books, and connecting with people of different cultures and interests.
